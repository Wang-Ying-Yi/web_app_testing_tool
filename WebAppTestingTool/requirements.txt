Here's a sample `requirements.txt` file for your **Web Application Security Testing Tool**. This file lists the Python packages your project depends on, and users can install them using `pip`:

### `requirements.txt`

```
requests==2.28.1
beautifulsoup4==4.11.1
lxml==4.9.2  # Optional: If you're using BeautifulSoup with the lxml parser for faster processing
argparse==1.4.0
``` 

### Explanation of the Dependencies:
- **`requests`**: Used for making HTTP requests to web applications.
- **`beautifulsoup4`**: A library for parsing HTML and XML, helpful for analyzing web page structure in XSS and other vulnerability checks.
- **`lxml`**: An optional dependency used by BeautifulSoup for faster HTML parsing.
- **`argparse`**: Helps with command-line argument parsing.

### Install Instructions:

After creating the `requirements.txt`, users can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have additional dependencies (such as `subprocess`, although it's built-in in Python), add them to this list.
