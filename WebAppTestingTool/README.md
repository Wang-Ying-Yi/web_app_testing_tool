You're welcome! Here's a sample `README.md` file for your **Web Application Security Testing Tool**. You can modify it based on the exact details of your project.

# Web Application Security Testing Tool

This tool is designed to test web applications for common vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **brute force attacks**, and **directory traversal**, as well as check for the presence of important **HTTP security headers**. It can be used by security professionals and developers to identify security issues in their web applications.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Tests if a web application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks by using common payloads.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: Detects XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious JavaScript into form fields and URLs.
- **Brute Force Attack Simulation**: Attempts to break into web applications by brute-forcing login forms with a list of username-password combinations.
- **Directory Traversal Vulnerability Testing**: Checks for directory traversal issues by trying to access sensitive files on the server.
- **HTTP Header Security Check**: Ensures that important security headers like `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options` are implemented.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-app-security-tool.git
cd web-app-security-tool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to have Python 3 installed on your system. This tool has been tested on Python 3.8+.

## Usage

You can run the tool by specifying the target URL for testing. Below are examples of how to run individual tests:

### SQL Injection Test

```bash
python3 src/sql_injection.py --url "http://example.com/?id="
```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Test

```bash
python3 src/xss_detection.py --url "http://example.com/search" --params '{"input": "query"}'
```

### Brute Force Attack Test

```bash
python3 src/brute_force.py --url "http://example.com/login" --usernames "usernames.txt" --passwords "passwords.txt"
```

### Directory Traversal Test

```bash
python3 src/directory_traversal.py --url "http://example.com/download?file="
```

### HTTP Header Check

```bash
python3 src/header_check.py --url "http://example.com"
```

### Run All Tests and Generate Report

You can run all tests at once and generate a report in JSON format:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --url "http://example.com"
```

The results will be saved in a file called `report.json` in the `reports/` directory.

## Sample Report

Hereâ€™s a [sample report](./reports/sample_report.json) that shows what the final output looks like. The tool will generate a report summarizing all detected vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Python Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `json`
  - `argparse`
  - `subprocess`

You can install all necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
